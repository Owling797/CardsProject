### >> The game process

First you have to make a choice of settings when starting up. Then will be an offer to make a choice about the number of cards and players.

At the start of the game you have your own 6-cards deck from the main deck.

Main deck contains 4 suits, each suit contains 9 (6...A) or 13(2...A) cards.

You also know a special trump suit.

#### If you’re the first to take a step:

To put a card down you need to choose the card and tap it’s suit and rank into the console. 

#### If you’re the defending one:

...then there is already a player who admitted his turn and you need to defend some cards that the first player(s) put down

1. Choose one of your cards, which can beat one of your opponent(s)’s put-down-cards, and enter it into the console. 
2. When you've beaten every card from the “cards to beat” list, the initiative will go to you (you will be the first to take a step).  
3. If it’s not possible to beat them, you need to enter ‘P’ and take cards to your deck.

#### Defence rules

Card (1) is able to beat another (2) if *they’re the same suit* and *card’s (1) rank is bigger then card’s (2)* or if *card’s (1) suit is trump*
